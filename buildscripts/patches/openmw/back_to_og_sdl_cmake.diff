+# Locate SDL2 library
+# This module defines
+# SDL2_LIBRARY, the SDL2 library, with no other libraries
+# SDL2_LIBRARIES, the SDL library and required components with compiler flags
+# SDL2_FOUND, if false, do not try to link to SDL2
+# SDL2_INCLUDE_DIR, where to find SDL.h
+# SDL2_VERSION, the version of the found library
+#
+# This module accepts the following env variables
+#  SDL2DIR - Can be set to ./configure --prefix=$SDL2DIR used in building SDL2. l.e.galup 9-20-02
+# This module responds to the the flag:
+# SDL2_BUILDING_LIBRARY
+# If this is defined, then no SDL2_main will be linked in because
+# only applications need main().
+# Otherwise, it is assumed you are building an application and this
+# module will attempt to locate and set the the proper link flags
+# as part of the returned SDL2_LIBRARIES variable.
+#
+# Don't forget to include SDL2main.h and SDL2main.m your project for the
+# OS X framework based version. (Other versions link to -lSDL2main which
+# this module will try to find on your behalf.) Also for OS X, this
+# module will automatically add the -framework Cocoa on your behalf.
+#
+#
+# Modified by Eric Wing.
+# Added code to assist with automated building by using environmental variables
+# and providing a more controlled/consistent search behavior.
+# Added new modifications to recognize OS X frameworks and
+# additional Unix paths (FreeBSD, etc).
+# Also corrected the header search path to follow "proper" SDL2 guidelines.
+# Added a search for SDL2main which is needed by some platforms.
+# Added a search for threads which is needed by some platforms.
+# Added needed compile switches for MinGW.
+#
+# On OSX, this will prefer the Framework version (if found) over others.
+# People will have to manually change the cache values of
+# SDL2_LIBRARY to override this selection or set the CMake environment
+# CMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH to modify the search paths.
+#
+# Note that the header path has changed from SDL2/SDL.h to just SDL.h
+# This needed to change because "proper" SDL2 convention
+# is #include "SDL.h", not <SDL2/SDL.h>. This is done for portability
+# reasons because not all systems place things in SDL2/ (see FreeBSD).
+#
+# Ported by Johnny Patterson. This is a literal port for SDL2 of the FindSDL.cmake
+# module with the minor edit of changing "SDL" to "SDL2" where necessary. This
+# was not created for redistribution, and exists temporarily pending official
+# SDL2 CMake modules.
